              "'Page: Puri\\nSummary: Puri (Odia: [ˈpuɾi] (listen)) is a coastal city and a municipality in the state of Odisha in eastern India. It is the district headquarters of Puri district and is situated on the Bay of Bengal, 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of the state capital of Bhubaneswar. It is also known as Sri Jagannatha Dhama after the 12th-century Jagannath Temple located in the city. The height of the temple is 214 ft. It is one of the original Char Dham  pilgrimage sites for Hindus.\\nPuri is known by several names since the ancient times, and was locally known as \"Sri Kshetra\" and the Jagannath temple is known as \"Badadeula\". Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim rulers, from the 7th century AD till the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of the temple. The height of the temple is  Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of British India from 1803 till India attained independence in August 1947. Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the House of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple town has many Hindu religious mathas or monasteries.\\nThe economy of Puri is dependent on the religious importance of the Jagannath Temple to the extent of nearly 80 percent. The 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple complex contribute to the economy; Ratha Yatra and its related festivals are the most important which are attended by millions of people every year. Sand art and applique art are some of the important crafts of the city.\\nPuri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India.\\nPuri is a significant part of the \"Krishna pilgrimage circuit\" which also includes Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Gokula, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Dwarka.\\n\\nPage: Jagannath Temple, Puri\\nSummary: The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu – one of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism. Puri is in the state of Odisha, on the eastern coast of India. The Somavamsa king Indradyumna of Abanti has built the main temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri. The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards, on the site of pre-existing temples in the compound but not the main Jagannatha temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.The puri temple is also famous because many legends believe that Lord Krishna’s heart was placed there and the material that it is made from damages the heart so they have to change it every twelve years.\\nThe temple is sacred to all Hindus, and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great Vaishnava saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhan Math, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.\\n\\nPage: Char Dham\\nSummary: The Char Dham (meaning: four abodes) is a set of four pilgrimage sites in India. It is believed that visiting these sites helps achieve moksha (salvation). The four Dhams are, Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameswaram. It is believed that every Hindu should visit the Char Dhams during one\\'s lifetime. The Char Dham as defined by Adi Shankaracharya consists of four Hindu pilgrimage sites. \\nThese main \\'dhamas\\' are the shrines of Lord Vishnu and Rameshwaram is a shrine of lord Shiva.\\nAll the \\'dhamas\\' are related to four epochs,(1) Dham of Satyuga- Badrinath, Uttarakhand (2) Dham of Tretayuga -Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu (3) Dham of Dwaparayuga - Dvaraka, Gujarat (4) Dham of Kaliyuga - Jagannatha Puri, Odisha.\\nAnother small circuit in Uttarakhand of four pilgrimage sites-Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath is referred to as Chota Char Dham which is locally popular in North India.'"

We construct a Knowledge Graph from Aircraft Accident reports and contribute this resource to the community of researchers. The efficacy of this resource is tested and proved by the aforesaid QA system. There is a need for a system to efficiently access these diverse repositories to serve the demands of the aviation industry, such as maintenance, compliance, and safety. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) guided Deep Learning (DL) based Question Answering (QA) system to cater to these requirements. Identifying safety anomalies and vulnerabilities in the aviation domain is a very expensive and time-consuming task. Currently, it is accomplished via manual forensic reviews by subject matter experts (SMEs). However, with the increase in the amount of data produced in airspace operations, relying on such manual reviews is impractical. Automated approaches, such as exceedance detection, have ... A deep-learning-based model for accident-type prediction during approach and landing was established, which explores the implied association between accident types and accident factors from the risk factors affecting the occurrence of unsafe events. ... and incorporate key accident factors into the assessment scope of civil aircraft safety ...
