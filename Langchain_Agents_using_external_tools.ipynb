              "'Page: Puri\\nSummary: Puri (Odia: [ˈpuɾi] (listen)) is a coastal city and a municipality in the state of Odisha in eastern India. It is the district headquarters of Puri district and is situated on the Bay of Bengal, 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of the state capital of Bhubaneswar. It is also known as Sri Jagannatha Dhama after the 12th-century Jagannath Temple located in the city. The height of the temple is 214 ft. It is one of the original Char Dham  pilgrimage sites for Hindus.\\nPuri is known by several names since the ancient times, and was locally known as \"Sri Kshetra\" and the Jagannath temple is known as \"Badadeula\". Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim rulers, from the 7th century AD till the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of the temple. The height of the temple is  Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of British India from 1803 till India attained independence in August 1947. Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the House of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple town has many Hindu religious mathas or monasteries.\\nThe economy of Puri is dependent on the religious importance of the Jagannath Temple to the extent of nearly 80 percent. The 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple complex contribute to the economy; Ratha Yatra and its related festivals are the most important which are attended by millions of people every year. Sand art and applique art are some of the important crafts of the city.\\nPuri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India.\\nPuri is a significant part of the \"Krishna pilgrimage circuit\" which also includes Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Gokula, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Dwarka.\\n\\nPage: Jagannath Temple, Puri\\nSummary: The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu – one of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism. Puri is in the state of Odisha, on the eastern coast of India. The Somavamsa king Indradyumna of Abanti has built the main temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri. The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards, on the site of pre-existing temples in the compound but not the main Jagannatha temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.The puri temple is also famous because many legends believe that Lord Krishna’s heart was placed there and the material that it is made from damages the heart so they have to change it every twelve years.\\nThe temple is sacred to all Hindus, and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great Vaishnava saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhan Math, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.\\n\\nPage: Char Dham\\nSummary: The Char Dham (meaning: four abodes) is a set of four pilgrimage sites in India. It is believed that visiting these sites helps achieve moksha (salvation). The four Dhams are, Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameswaram. It is believed that every Hindu should visit the Char Dhams during one\\'s lifetime. The Char Dham as defined by Adi Shankaracharya consists of four Hindu pilgrimage sites. \\nThese main \\'dhamas\\' are the shrines of Lord Vishnu and Rameshwaram is a shrine of lord Shiva.\\nAll the \\'dhamas\\' are related to four epochs,(1) Dham of Satyuga- Badrinath, Uttarakhand (2) Dham of Tretayuga -Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu (3) Dham of Dwaparayuga - Dvaraka, Gujarat (4) Dham of Kaliyuga - Jagannatha Puri, Odisha.\\nAnother small circuit in Uttarakhand of four pilgrimage sites-Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath is referred to as Chota Char Dham which is locally popular in North India.'"

What motivated you to study heat-bath random walks on graphs of lattice points?\n2. Can you provide an example of a set of moves that satisfies the conditions for the heat-bath random walk to be an expander?\n3.

As a language model, Assistant is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\\n\\nAssistant is constantly learning and improving, and its capabilities are constantly evolving. It is able to process and understand large amounts of text, and can use this knowledge to provide accurate and informative responses to a wide range of questions. Additionally, Assistant is able to generate its own text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in discussions and provide explanations and descriptions on a wide range of topics.\\n\\nAssiatant should perform the following:-\\n 1. summarizes the paper by author(s) in one concise sentence. \\n 2. Then, list key insights and lessons learned from the paper. \\n 3. Next, generate 3-5 questions that you would like to ask the authors about their work. \\n 4. Finally, provide 3-5 suggestions for related topics or future research directions based on the content of the paper. \\n 5. If applicable, list at least 5 relevant references from the field of study of the paper.\\n\\nOverall, Assistant is a powerful system that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.
