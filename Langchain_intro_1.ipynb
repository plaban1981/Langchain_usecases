Refresh the page: Sometimes, simply refreshing the page can resolve the issue.\\n\\n2. Check your internet connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection. A slow or intermittent connection can cause videos to not load or play properly.\\n\\n3. Try a different browser: If you're using a specific browser, try switching to a different one (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to see if the video plays correctly.\\n\\n4. Clear your browser cache: Clearing your browser's cache can help resolve any temporary issues that may be causing the video playback problem.\\n\\n5. Disable browser extensions: Some browser extensions or add-ons can interfere with video playback. Try disabling any extensions you have installed and see if the video plays.\\n\\n6. Contact the course provider: If none of the above steps work, reach out to the course provider's support team for further assistance. They may be able to provide specific troubleshooting steps or address any technical issues on their end.\\n\\nRemember to provide them with specific details about the problem you're experiencing, such as the course name, the specific video that's not playing, and any error messages you may be seeing.\""

My name is Jane Smith and I am a subscriber to your online courses. I\\'ve been really enjoying the content, but starting from July 1, 2023, I\\'ve unfortunately been experiencing a video playback issue that has affected my ability to access the course materials.\\n\\nThe issue involves the videos taking an unusually long time to load. When they eventually do load, they either buffer constantly in the middle of playback, or the video quality drops significantly. This has made it extremely difficult for me to follow along with the course materials.\\n\\nI wanted to let you know that I have tried a few things on my end to resolve the issue. I\\'ve verified that my internet connection is strong and reliable, so that doesn\\'t seem to be the problem. I\\'ve also tried accessing your platform on multiple devices and browsers, but the issue persists across all of them. Finally, I tried clearing my browser cache and cookies in case that was causing an issue, but it did not lead to any improvements.\\n\\nI really enjoy the course content and I would love to continue learning with Mitra AI. Could you please assist me in resolving this issue?\\n\\nThank you so much for your time and help.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nJane Smith\\n\\n\\nThe output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing \"```json\" and \"```\":\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\"customer_name\": string  // The name of the person signing the email.
