(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation:\\n\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\\n\\nBasis of Consolidation:\\n\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.\\n\\nUse of Estimates:\\n\\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments; useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\\n\\nThis is a partial representation of the content. For full details, please refer to the original document.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19\\n\\nVarious governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions. These restrictions have had an adverse impact on Uber\\'s business and operations by reducing global demand for Mobility offerings while accelerating the growth of Delivery offerings. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber\\'s future business operations, financial position, and cash flows remains uncertain.\\n\\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10, \"Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,\" which requires disclosures about transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on Uber\\'s financial statements.\\n\\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nUber is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,\" on its consolidated financial statements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.\\n\\n## Revenue\\n\\n**Revenue Disaggregated by Offering and Geographical Region**\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Mobility revenue|$853 million|$2,518 million|\\n|Delivery revenue|$1,741 million|$2,512 million|\\n|Freight revenue|$301 million|$1,824 million|\\n|All Other revenue|$8 million|—|\\n|Total revenue|$2,903 million|$6,854 million|\\n\\n### Revenue by Geographical Region\\n\\n**Revenue by Geographical Region**\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|United States and Canada (\"US&CAN\")|$1,849 million|$4,562 million|\\n|Latin America (\"LatAm\")|$302 million|$432 million|\\n|Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\")|$225 million|$1,127 million|\\n|Asia Pacific (\"APAC\")|$527 million|$733 million|\\n|Total revenue|$2,903 million|$6,854 million|\\n\\n### Mobility Revenue\\n\\nUber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of its platform(s) and related services to facilitate mobility services. Mobility revenue also includes revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber\\'s sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services to the end-user. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. In markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services, revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis, while payments to drivers are recognized in cost of revenue.\\n\\n## Delivery Revenue\\n\\nUber derives revenue for Delivery from Merchants\\' and Couriers\\' use of the Delivery platform to facilitate transactions. In markets where Uber is responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue, while payments to Couriers are recognized in cost of revenue.\\n\\n## Freight Revenue\\n\\nFreight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.\\n\\n## All Other Revenue\\n\\nPrior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily included collaboration revenue related to Uber\\'s Advanced Technologies Group (\"ATG\") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.\\n\\n## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation\\n\\nContract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material. The remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized accordingly.\\n\\n## Investments and Fair Value Measurement\\n\\n### Investments\\n\\nUber\\'s investments on the balance sheets included non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities (Didi, Grab, Aurora, Other), and a note receivable from a related party. The total investments as of March 31, 2022, amounted to $6.247 billion.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\\n\\n## Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\\n\\n|Non-marketable Equity Securities|Note Receivables|MLU B.V.

Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\n\\nNon-Financial Assets\\n\\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.\\n\\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\\n\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\\n\\nWe did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.\\n\\n**Summary of Non-Marketable Equity Securities**\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Initial cost basis|$279|$281|\\n|Upward adjustments|$4|$4|\\n|Downward adjustments (including impairment)|$0|$0|\\n|Total carrying value at the end of the period|$283|$285|\\n\\nNote 4 – Equity Method Investments\\n\\n**Carrying Value of Equity Method Investments**\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|MLU B.V.|$751|$574|\\n|Mission Bay 3 & 4|$38|$37|\\n|Other|$11|$13|\\n|Total equity method investments|$800|$624|\\n\\nMLU B.V. Investment\\n\\nWe reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\\n\\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\\n\\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying value of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.’s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.\\'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.\\n\\n## MLU B.V. Call Option\\n\\nOn August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022.\\n\\n### Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\n\\n|Segment|Balance as of Dec 31, 2021|Acquisitions|Measurement Period Adjustment|Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment|Balance as of Mar 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Mobility|$2,581|$64|-|($56)|$2,589|\\n|Delivery|$4,401|-|-|$2|$4,403|\\n|Freight|$1,438|-|$5|-|$1,443|\\n|Total Goodwill|$8,420|$64|$5|($54)|$8,435|\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Quarterly Report\\n\\n## Stockholders\\' Equity\\n\\nEquity Compensation Plans\\n\\nWe maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and other employees, directors, and consultants: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have all been approved by stockholders. Following our IPO in 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).\\n\\n### Stock Option and SAR Activity\\n\\n| |Options Outstanding|Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years)|Aggregate Intrinsic Value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of December 31, 2021|157|4.35|$735 million|\\n|Granted|4| | |\\n|Exercised|(3)| | |\\n|Canceled and forfeited| | | |\\n|As of March 31, 2022|158|4.10|$558 million|\\n\\n### RSU Activity\\n\\n| |Number of Shares|Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Unvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2021|71,461|$41.91|\\n|Granted|59,266|$33.65|\\n|Vested|(9,699)|$39.24|\\n|Canceled and forfeited|(4,073)|$39.87|\\n|Unvested and outstanding as of March 31, 2022|116,955|$37.99|\\n\\n### Stock-Based Compensation Expense\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31|\\n|---|---|\\n|Operations and support|$28 million (2021) / $33 million (2022)|\\n|Sales and marketing|$22 million (2021) / $22 million (2022)|\\n|Research and development|$133 million (2021) / $196 million (2022)|\\n|General and administrative|$98 million (2021) / $108 million (2022)|\\n|Total|$281 million (2021) / $359 million (2022)|\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, there was $4.5 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.91 years.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nThe tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n## Note 9 – Income Taxes\\n\\nWe compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands\\' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\\n\\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.\\n\\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\\n\\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\\n\\n## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\\n\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\\n\\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\\n\\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\\n\\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\n### Driver Classification\\n\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\n\\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\\n\\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\\n\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\\n\\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\\n\\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021.

The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.\\n\\n## Driver Classification Developments\\n\\nUber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been significant legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers engaged in independent work. Uber has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.\\n\\nIn the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as \"workers\" rather than independent contractors. The Supreme Court of the UK upheld this ruling in February 2021, leading Uber to initiate a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers. More than 70,000 mobility drivers in the UK will now be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving other benefits.\\n\\nThese developments may have financial implications for Uber but are not expected to have a material impact on the company\\'s business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains the financial and operational highlights for Uber Technologies, Inc. for the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\n## Financial and Operational Highlights\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|% Change|% Change (Constant Currency)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”)|98|115|17%| |\\n|Trips|1,447|1,713|18%| |\\n|Gross Bookings|$19,536|$26,449|35%|39%|\\n|Revenue|$2,903|$6,854|136%|141%|\\n|Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.|($108)|($5,930)|**| |\\n|Mobility Adjusted EBITDA|$298|$618|107%| |\\n|Delivery Adjusted EBITDA|($200)|$30|**| |\\n|Adjusted EBITDA|($359)|$168|**| |\\n|Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities|($611)|$15|**| |\\n|Free cash flow|($682)|($47)|93%| |\\n\\n** Percentage not meaningful.\\n\\n### Highlights for the First Quarter 2022\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) were 115 million, declining 3 million, or 3%, quarter-over-quarter, but growing 17% compared to the same period in 2021. The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022 with the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform increasing from 111 million in January 2022 to 121 million in March 2022.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nOverall Gross Bookings increased to $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, or 39% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2021.\\n\\nMobility Gross Bookings grew 62% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 15% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, outpacing Delivery Trip growth, as we saw a 3% increase in basket sizes globally driven by stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19.\\n\\nRevenue was $6.9 billion, up 136% year-over-year, with a Take Rate of 25.9%. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in our Freight business due to the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) during the fourth quarter of 2021, the favorable impact to revenue of $200 million due to a change in the accounting model for our UK Mobility business, as well as a favorable comparative impact to the same period in 2021 where, during the first quarter of 2021, revenue was reduced by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.\\n\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $5.9 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net of $5.6 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $1.9 billion unrealized loss on our Grab investment; a $1.7 billion unrealized loss on our Aurora investments; a $1.4 billion unrealized loss on our Didi investment; and a $462 million unrealized loss on our Zomato investment. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $359 million of stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $168 million, up $527 million compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit improved by 107%, year-over-year, to $618 million. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $30 million, up $230 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $200 million in the same period in 2021. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\\n\\n## Other Developments\\n\\n### COVID-19\\n\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities’ and states’ declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n### COVID-19 Response Initiatives\\n\\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\\n\\nTo comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended, our shared Mobility offering, in most markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability.\\n\\nWe are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any future waves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the further impact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Components of Results of Operations\\n\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. Revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and incentives. We act as an agent in connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants for transportation services.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and concluded we are responsible for providing mobility services to end-users. Revenue from end-users in these markets is presented on a gross basis, while payments to Drivers are recognized in cost of revenue.\\n\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, and payments to Drivers and Couriers for services. These costs fluctuate with Trip volume changes on the platform.\\n\\nOperations and support expenses include compensation for employees supporting operations, customer support, and certain corporate costs. As Trip volume increases, we expect these expenses to rise but decrease as a percentage of revenue.\\n\\nSales and marketing expenses cover compensation costs, advertising, promotions, and discounts. These expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of revenue due to marketing campaign timing.\\n\\nResearch and development expenses include compensation for employees in engineering and product development. These expenses are expected to increase as we invest in ongoing improvements to our platform offerings.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nGeneral and Administrative\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.\\n\\nInterest Expense\\n\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.\\n\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\\n\\n- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\\n- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\\n- Gain on business divestiture.\\n- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.\\n- Impairment of equity method investment.\\n- Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V. Call Option”).\\n- Other, net.\\n\\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands\\' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.\\n\\nEquity Method Investments\\n\\nEquity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

There was also a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue due to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was unfavorably impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK.

Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\\n\\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\n## Adjusted EBITDA\\n\\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding various items such as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and other specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. It provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\\n\\n## COVID-19 Response Initiatives\\n\\nTo support those impacted by COVID-19, we have implemented initiatives including financial assistance to Drivers, distribution of personal protective equipment, free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers and seniors, and charitable donations. These initiatives are recorded accordingly in our financial statements.\\n\\n## Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and should be considered supplemental. It does not replace financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Limitations include excluding certain non-cash charges and not reflecting all cash capital expenditure requirements.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Constant currency growth rate information is presented to assess underlying revenue performance excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Constant currency is calculated by translating current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Free Cash Flow\\n\\nWe define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. The following table presents reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated:\\n\\n**Three Months Ended March 31**\\n|(In millions)|2021|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Free cash flow reconciliation:|$ (611)|$ 15|\\n|Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities|$ (611)|$ 15|\\n|Purchases of property and equipment|$ (71)|$ (62)|\\n|Free cash flow|$ (682)|$ (47)|\\n\\n46\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities|$(611) million|$15 million|\\n|Net cash used in investing activities|$(250) million|$(135) million|\\n|Net cash used in financing activities|$(226) million|$(113) million|\\n\\n## Operating Activities\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $5.9 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $5.6 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $359 million of stock-based compensation expense and $254 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $27 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves.\\n\\nNet cash used in operating activities was $611 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $122 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion gain on business divestiture and $281 million of stock-based compensation expense as well as a $412 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\\n\\n## Investing Activities\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $803 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $336 million in purchases of marketable securities and $216 million in purchases of a note receivable, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $696 million and $500 million in proceeds from the sale of non-marketable equity securities.\\n\\n## Financing Activities\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $113 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million of principal payments on finance leases.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $194 million of principal repayment on Careem Notes.\\n\\n## Other Information\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, $2.2 billion of our $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic\\'s impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\\n\\n## Purchase Commitments\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n\\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\\n\\n### Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\n### Investment Risk\\n\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\\n\\n### Foreign Currency Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\\n\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\\n\\n## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\n### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n## Management Discussion and Analysis\\n\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\n\\n### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are reviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n### Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\n\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\\n\\n## Other Information\\n\\n### Legal Proceedings\\n\\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most significant of these matters are described below.\\n\\n#### Legal Proceedings Described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nNote 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 12 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:\\n\\n- Driver Classification\\n- State Unemployment Taxes\\n- Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\\n\\n#### Legal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nIn addition to the matters that are identified in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.\\n\\n##### Australia Class Actions\\n\\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\\n\\n##### Other Legal Proceedings\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n## Legal Actions, Investigations, and Proceedings\\n\\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\n\\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\\n\\n### Risk Factor Summary\\n\\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business.\\n- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\\n- The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\\n- To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\\n- We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\n- If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\\n- Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\n- Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.\\n- If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\\n- Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\\n- We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Risks Related to Our Business\\n\\n## General Economic Risks\\n\\nThe coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility.\\n\\n## Other Risks\\n\\n- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.\\n- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\\n- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\\n- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\\n- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.\\n- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.\\n- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\n- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\\n- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\n- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\n- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\n- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.\\'s performance for a specific quarter, including unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.\\n\\n## Operational Risks\\n\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\\n\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.\\n\\nWe believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\\n\\n## Financial Impact of COVID-19\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required and may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models of our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts.\\n\\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer.\\n\\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a generated HTML document for demonstration purposes.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\n\\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\\n\\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\\n\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\\n\\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Competition Overview\\n\\nUber faces competition in each of its offerings, including:\\n\\n## Mobility\\n\\nCompetes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.\\n\\n## Delivery\\n\\nCompetes with companies in meal, grocery, and other delivery space, as well as restaurants and traditional grocers.\\n\\n## Freight\\n\\nCompetes with global and North American freight brokers.\\n\\nCompetitors offer discounted services, incentives, and alternative pricing models, posing challenges to Uber\\'s market position.\\n\\nContractual restrictions with minority-owned affiliates limit competition in certain regions until specific dates.\\n\\n# Market Strategy\\n\\nTo remain competitive, Uber has lowered fares, offered Driver incentives, and consumer discounts.

As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase, potentially impacting profitability in major markets.\\n\\n## Operating Expenses and Revenue Generation\\n\\nUber anticipates increased operating expenses in the future due to investments in expanding its platform, research and development, marketing, and new offerings.

We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\n\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.\\n\\nWe have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\\n\\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\\n\\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\n\\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

These investments include acquisitions like Cornershop for online grocery delivery and The Drizly Group, Inc. for on-demand alcohol marketplace. Uber Freight also acquired Transplace to expand its business. The company plans to invest resources in developing new offerings and technologies in various markets.\\n\\nThe new initiatives involve risks due to nascent industries, unproven business strategies, and limited operating experience. Claims, liabilities, expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks may arise. Consumer demand, market acceptance, and revenue generation from these initiatives are uncertain. Competition and obsolescence risks exist, and development efforts may divert resources from established products.\\n\\nOverall, the success of new products, offerings, and technologies is crucial for Uber\\'s future growth and competitiveness in the market.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. Operating internationally presents various risks and challenges that differ from those faced in the United States:\\n\\n- Operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences\\n- Localization requirements including translation of apps and websites, and adherence to local laws and regulations\\n- Compliance with stricter laws and regulations in areas such as competition, pricing, payment methods, and transportation services\\n- Competition from local companies with better market understanding and government favor\\n- Varying levels of social acceptance and technological compatibility\\n- Exposure to different business cultures and legal uncertainties\\n- Management difficulties, including staffing, labor unions, and work stoppages\\n- Impact of currency exchange rates and cash transactions\\n- Regulations affecting fare collection and remittance, tax consequences, and financial reporting complexities\\n- Challenges related to trade regulations, political instability, security concerns, and societal crime conditions\\n\\nThese factors can significantly affect Uber\\'s international operations and financial performance.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nPublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, pose risks to Uber\\'s international operations. Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets also presents challenges.\\n\\nUber\\'s ownership in minority-owned affiliates, such as Didi, Grab, Zomato, and others, involves significant risks outside its control. Lack of representation on management teams or boards of these entities may lead to decisions or actions that could impact Uber\\'s assets and financial results.\\n\\nAny decline in the business of these entities could adversely affect the value of Uber\\'s assets. Market valuations of these entities, influenced by financial markets, may impact Uber\\'s financial results. Volatility in stock prices of these entities, if publicly traded, could also affect Uber\\'s financial performance.\\n\\nUber faces challenges related to limited operating histories, evolving industries, unpredictable results, limited public information, economic and political risks in various countries, and the need for substantial capital to support operations and expansion of its affiliates.\\n\\nContractual limitations may restrict Uber\\'s ability to sell or transfer assets, such as a 4-year lock-up period for shares in Aurora. Lack of a public market for these securities and potential tax implications upon sale or transfer of assets may impact Uber\\'s ability to realize the long-term value of its investments.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\n\\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\\n\\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\n\\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.\\n\\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:\\n\\n- grow supply and demand on our platform;\\n- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\\n- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\\n- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\\n- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\\n- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\\n- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\\n- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\\n- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\\n- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\\n- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\\n- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\\n- increase positive perception of our brand.\\n\\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.\\'s financial performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.\\n\\nBelow is an excerpt from the report:\\n\\nFailure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\\n\\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas.\\n\\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.\\n\\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.\\'s performance for a specific quarter, including discussions on autonomous vehicle technologies, risks and liabilities, government regulations, personnel management, and succession planning.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n\\n- Development of autonomous vehicle technologies by competitors like Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, and Nuro.\\n- Risks and liabilities associated with autonomous vehicle technologies, including collisions and regulatory scrutiny.\\n- Potential impact of federal and state regulations on Uber\\'s ability to offer autonomous vehicles.\\n- Challenges in retaining high-quality personnel and the impact of attrition on Uber\\'s business.\\n- Concerns about leadership transitions, management changes, and succession planning.\\n\\n## Autonomous Vehicle Technologies\\n\\nCompetitors are developing autonomous vehicle technologies that may impact Uber\\'s competitiveness in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries.\\n\\nChallenges include potential cost reductions, regulatory scrutiny, and the need to comply with evolving regulations.\\n\\n## Personnel Management and Succession Planning\\n\\nUber\\'s success depends on attracting and retaining high-quality personnel, including management, operations, and engineering staff.\\n\\nChallenges related to workplace practices, attrition, and leadership transitions may affect Uber\\'s business and operating results.\\n\\n### Key Personnel and Leadership\\n\\nRetention of key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, is crucial for Uber\\'s growth and success.\\n\\nSuccession planning and effective management of leadership transitions are essential to maintain business continuity and reputation.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.\\n\\n## Impact of Economic Conditions\\n\\nThe performance of Uber is subject to economic conditions and their impact on discretionary consumer spending. Factors such as general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, energy prices, and interest rates can affect consumer behavior and preferences. Shifts in consumer behavior during recessionary periods may impact Uber\\'s network liquidity and overall business performance.\\n\\n## Cost Factors\\n\\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and global supply chain challenges can adversely affect Uber\\'s operating results. These cost factors may impact drivers, carriers, and merchants operating on the platform, leading to changes in service availability and pricing.\\n\\n## Security and Privacy Concerns\\n\\nUber faces risks related to security breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data, including personal information of users and employees. Any such breaches could result in revenue loss, harm to the brand, and business disruption.

These incidents exposed personal information of drivers and consumers, leading to potential liabilities, litigation risks, and governmental investigations.\\n\\nAcquisitions like Careem and Drizly have also faced data security incidents, which could result in liabilities, business disruption, and harm to the brand if not properly addressed.\\n\\n## Product Development and User Retention\\n\\nThe success of Uber\\'s platform relies on introducing new products and features to retain and attract drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. Failure to do so may lead to reduced demand, driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on operations.\\n\\nInvesting in the development of new offerings that add value and differentiate Uber from competitors is crucial for maintaining user engagement and platform usage.\\n\\n## Operational Metrics and Challenges\\n\\nUber tracks operational metrics internally, including MAPCs, Trips, and Gross Bookings, which may differ from third-party estimates. Inaccuracies in reported metrics could harm Uber\\'s reputation and business performance.\\n\\nThere are inherent challenges in measuring and tracking product performance, and any errors in data reporting could impact the accuracy of disclosed metrics.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nBelow are some key points from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission:\\n\\n## Concerns with Multiple Accounts and Data Accuracy\\n\\nUber acknowledges the presence of consumers with multiple accounts, which goes against their Terms of Service. Inaccuracies in data measurement could impact their business strategies and financial results.\\n\\n## Use of Cash in Certain Jurisdictions\\n\\nIn some regions, Uber allows consumers to pay for rides and deliveries using cash, posing regulatory, operational, and safety challenges. Cash-paid trips accounted for 7% of global Gross Bookings in 2021.\\n\\n## Infrastructure Challenges with Cash Payments\\n\\nEstablishing systems to ensure correct service fees on cash trips is complex. Inadequate systems could lead to revenue loss and compliance risks, including anti-money laundering laws.\\n\\n## Credit Card Acceptance Privileges\\n\\n74% of Gross Bookings in 2021 were paid by credit or debit cards. Loss of credit card acceptance privileges could significantly impact Uber\\'s business model and financial performance.\\n\\n## Cybersecurity Concerns\\n\\nUber faces risks from cyberattacks such as malware, ransomware, and phishing, which could damage their reputation and operations.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the full quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the SEC.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about the business, operations, and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.\\n\\nBelow is an excerpt from the report discussing the reliance on information technology systems and potential risks:\\n\\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our systems contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data. Cyberattacks have occurred in the past and may happen in the future, posing risks to our security and operations. Various factors may cause system failures or security breaches, potentially impacting our business.\\n\\nFurthermore, the report highlights the complexity of Uber\\'s platform and the potential impact of undetected errors:\\n\\nOur platform is a complex system with many components. Undetected errors in our software could lead to compliance issues, downtime, and disruptions in service availability. We have experienced outages in the past and may encounter more in the future, which could affect our reputation and financial results.\\n\\nThese excerpts emphasize the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity measures and addressing software vulnerabilities to ensure the smooth operation of Uber\\'s platform.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\\n\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\n\\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\n\\nDependencies on Third Parties\\n\\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.\\n\\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.\\n\\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Ownership changes could further limit the utilization of tax attributes, potentially increasing future tax liability.\\n\\nUber is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in multiple currencies. Currency rate changes can impact financial results, and the company may consider hedging arrangements in the future to manage foreign currency translation risks.\\n\\nIf Uber is unable to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses, its operating results and prospects could be harmed. Acquired businesses may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated, posing risks to Uber\\'s financial condition and operating results.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nForm joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates, Drizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\\n\\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.\\n\\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\\n\\n- Diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration\\n- Disrupting our ongoing business operations\\n- Platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings\\n- Implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company\\n- Integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines\\n- Retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption\\n- Maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business\\n- Integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own\\n- Integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience\\n- Liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company\\n- Litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company\\n- Impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets\\n\\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions. For example, with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and each company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.\\n\\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\\n\\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Uber\\'s Business\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. faces legal and regulatory risks in various jurisdictions that may impact its operations and financial performance. Some of the key points include:\\n\\n## Business Model Challenges in Certain Jurisdictions\\n\\nIn expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, Uber\\'s ridesharing business model has faced obstacles such as being blocked, capped, or suspended due to regulatory restrictions. Uber has had to adapt its business model in response to laws and regulations in these jurisdictions.\\n\\n## Impact of Regulatory Changes\\n\\nRegulatory changes, such as minimum pay standards for drivers and licensing requirements, have affected Uber\\'s operations in cities like New York City, Barcelona, and Chicago. These changes have had adverse effects on Uber\\'s financial performance in certain locations.\\n\\n## Global Regulatory Environment\\n\\nUber is subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that may be ambiguous or challenging to comply with. In some cases, Uber may face fines, legal proceedings, or the need to cease operations if regulatory issues are not resolved. For example, legal challenges in Hong Kong and Colombia have impacted Uber\\'s ability to offer ridesharing services in those regions.\\n\\nThese legal and regulatory risks pose challenges to Uber\\'s business growth and financial performance, requiring the company to navigate complex regulatory environments in multiple jurisdictions.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, Uber\\'s platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles, including challenges from competitors and local governments globally. These obstacles may impact the company\\'s operations and revenue.\\n\\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\\n\\nUber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. The company operates in various jurisdictions with differing laws and regulations, and faces proposals that could harm its business model if adopted.\\n\\n### Impact of Laws and Regulations\\n\\nExisting or new laws and regulations could expose Uber to substantial liability and expenses, affecting the growth and usage of its platform. The company may face challenges in expanding into new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, due to healthcare-related laws and regulations.\\n\\n### Environmental Regulations\\n\\nUber\\'s business involving vehicles running on fossil fuels may be impacted by laws or governmental actions aimed at curbing air pollution or emissions. The company has taken steps to address such regulations, such as adding clean-air fees and transitioning to electric vehicles in certain regions.\\n\\n### Legal Challenges\\n\\nUber is involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions, including challenges to laws and regulations affecting its business. Legal proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are costly and time-consuming to defend, and adverse outcomes could result in financial damages or penalties.\\n\\n## Impact of Brexit\\n\\nFollowing the United Kingdom\\'s exit from the European Union on January 1, 2021, Uber faces changes in regulations and operations in the UK, which represented a significant portion of its global Mobility Gross Bookings.\\n\\n## Additional Risks\\n\\nDespite divesting certain assets, Uber continues to face risks related to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters, which present unique challenges compared to its other offerings in Mobility, Delivery, and Freight services.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nUsing dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\\n\\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\\n\\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\\n\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may block payments to Drivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received by those users.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\n## Payment Operations and Regulatory Compliance\\n\\nThe report highlights the impact of evolving laws related to money transmission and online payments on Uber\\'s payment operations. Changes in regulations could affect the company\\'s ability to provide payment processing services and comply with financial laws and regulations.\\n\\n### Legal Challenges and Investigations\\n\\nUber is currently facing inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from various government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and state Attorney General offices. These legal challenges cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance.\\n\\nThe company has settled claims related to past incidents, including breaches of consumer data, with regulatory bodies in the US and abroad. These settlements have involved significant financial penalties and ongoing regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\nRecent fines imposed by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations further underscore the regulatory challenges faced by Uber.\\n\\n### Impact on Business\\n\\nThe legal challenges, investigations, and regulatory fines could potentially disrupt Uber\\'s business operations, lead to financial penalties, and impact the company\\'s reputation. Compliance with evolving regulations and addressing legal issues remain key priorities for Uber.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about the risks faced by Uber Technologies, Inc. related to data collection, privacy, and security incidents. It also discusses the potential financial and operational impacts of regulatory actions and non-compliance with data protection laws.\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. has been subject to various investigations, inquiries, and litigation related to data privacy and security incidents. These incidents have led to fines, settlements, and regulatory actions by government agencies in the United States and internationally.\\n\\nThe company has entered into consent decrees, settlement agreements, and stipulated judgments with regulatory authorities to address data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these agreements could result in substantial fines and penalties.\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. faces risks from data security incidents experienced by companies it acquires, such as Careem and Drizly. These incidents could lead to brand harm, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\\n\\nThe company is also impacted by evolving data privacy laws, such as the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Non-compliance with these laws could result in substantial fines and injunctions against data processing.\\n\\nAs Uber Technologies, Inc. expands its operations domestically and internationally, it may be subject to additional laws and regulations that impose further obligations related to data privacy and security.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\\n\\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\\n\\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\\n\\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\\n\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\\n\\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties.\\n\\nOur activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control.\\n\\nOur acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws.\\n\\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform.\\n\\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company.\\n\\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\\n\\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs.\\n\\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\\n\\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\\n\\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\\n\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\\n\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information about the financial performance of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\\n\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Each RSU Election becomes irrevocable immediately following the deadline and applies solely to Compensation payable for services performed in the specified calendar year.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report\\n\\n4.2. Timing of RSU Election\\n\\n4.2.1. Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion.\\n\\n4.2.2. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make an RSU Election for services performed in the calendar year on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The RSU Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to Compensation earned with respect to services performed after the later of (a) the Effective Date, (b) the date on which the RSU Election Form is received by the Administrator, or (c) such later date as specified by the Administrator in the RSU Election Form.\\n\\n4.3. Effect of RSU Election\\n\\nOn each date that Compensation would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the portion of the Compensation subject to the RSU Election (to the extent not subject to a Deferral Election) shall be converted from cash into an RSU Award by dividing the dollar amount subject to the RSU Election by the average daily closing price per Share of the Company’s common stock in the month prior to the Conversion Date to determine the number of Shares underlying the RSU Award, with any fractional Share rounded up to the next whole Share.\\n\\n4.4. Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award\\n\\nTo the extent not subject to a Deferral Election, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying an RSU Award shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the Conversion Date, but in any event within 60 days following the Conversion Date.\\n\\n4.5. RSU Award Subject to Terms of Equity Incentive Plan\\n\\nRSU Awards made under this Section 4 (including, for purposes of clarification, such RSU Awards that are subject to a Deferral Election) shall be issued under the Equity Plan. As such, RSU Awards and any Award Agreements governing them are subject to the Equity Plan’s terms, including, by way of example and not limitation, the Equity Plan’s terms regard tax withholding, restrictions on awards and Shares (including clawback/recovery), and corporate events.\\n\\n5. Election to Defer RSUs\\n\\n5.1. Deferral Election\\n\\nA Director may elect to defer the issuance of a designated percentage of any or all of the Shares underlying an RSU Award (a “Deferral Election”), with such number of Shares rounded up to the next whole Share, by properly completing and filing a Deferral Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator. Each Deferral Election shall become irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making a Deferral Election under Section 5.2, and cannot be modified for any reason thereafter, except as provided in Section 5.4 below. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, a Deferral Election applies solely with respect to (a) Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation payable for services that are performed in the calendar year specified in the Deferral Election Form and does not apply with respect to Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation.\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc.

Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\",\n",

Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.

Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.

Uber has had to adapt its business model in response to laws and regulations in these jurisdictions.\\n\\nImpact of Regulatory Changes\\n\\nRegulatory changes, such as minimum pay standards for drivers and licensing requirements, have affected Uber's operations in cities like New York City, Barcelona, and Chicago. These changes have had adverse effects on Uber's financial performance in certain locations.\\n\\nGlobal Regulatory Environment\\n\\nUber is subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that may be ambiguous or challenging to comply with. In some cases, Uber may face fines, legal proceedings, or the need to cease operations if regulatory issues are not resolved. For example, legal challenges in Hong Kong and Colombia have impacted Uber's ability to offer ridesharing services in those regions.\\n\\nThese legal and regulatory risks pose challenges to Uber's business growth and financial performance, requiring the company to navigate complex regulatory environments in multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\nUber Quarterly Report\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries.

If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.

In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\\n\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\\n\\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas.\\n\\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.\",\n",
              "  'Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.',\n",

Quarterly Report\\n\\nLegal Actions, Investigations, and Proceedings\\n\\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\\n\\nRisk Factors',\n",

              "  'Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nUber Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.',\n",

In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction.

Uber has had to adapt its business model in response to laws and regulations in these jurisdictions.\\n\\nImpact of Regulatory Changes\\n\\nRegulatory changes, such as minimum pay standards for drivers and licensing requirements, have affected Uber's operations in cities like New York City, Barcelona, and Chicago. These changes have had adverse effects on Uber's financial performance in certain locations.\\n\\nGlobal Regulatory Environment\\n\\nUber is subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that may be ambiguous or challenging to comply with.

Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\\n\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection.

For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly',\n",
              "  'Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nUber Quarterly Report\\n\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.',\n",

Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.

The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday problems.\\n\\nDriver Classification Developments\\n\\nUber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been significant legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative, went into effect in December 2020 to provide a framework for drivers engaged in independent work. Uber has incurred additional expenses to comply with Proposition 22, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers and insurance for injury protection.\",\n",

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.',\n",

Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses.

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.',\n",
