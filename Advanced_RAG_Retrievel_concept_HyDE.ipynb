It is a system of beliefs that shape our decisions and actions, and guide us in how we should interact with other people. Ethics is concerned with what is right or wrong, and with determining what is the best course of action in any situation. Ethics is based on principles of respect, justice, fairness, and responsibility, and it is based on a shared set of values that are commonly accepted by society. In other words, ethics is about doing the right thing, even when it may not be the most convenient or popular thing to do.\",\n",

In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.  The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n36  \\n• Individual ethics are  personal st andards and values that determine how people view their \\nresponsibilities to other people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self -\\ninterest is at stake  \\n• Occupational ethics are standards that govern how members of a p articular pr ofession, trade or craft \\nshould conduct themselves when performing their work -related activities  \\n• Organizational ethics are the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view \\ntheir duties and responsibilities to the organ ization’s st akeholders (e.g., owners, managers, employees, \\nsuppliers and distributors, customers and the surrounding community)  \\n• Societal ethics are standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in \\nmatters that involve issues such  as fairness , justice, poverty and individual rights\\n\\nKelly and Williams also offered ethical rules and principles that managers could use to analyze the impact \\nof their decisions on org anizational stakeholders:  \\n \\n• The “utilitarian” rule:  An ethical decision is one that produces the greatest good for the greatest \\nnumber of people, which means that managers should compare alternative courses of action based on \\nthe benefits and costs of each  alternative  for different organizational stakeholders  \\n• The “moral rights” rule: An ethical decision is the one that best maintains and protects the fundamental \\nrights and privileges of the people affected by it, which means managers must take into account the \\neffectiv e of each alternative decision on the rights of each affected stakeholder group.  \\n• The “justice” rule: An ethical decision is one that distributes both the benefits and the harms among the \\norganizational stakeholders in a fair, equitable or impar tial manner\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and\\n\\n• The “practical” rule: An ethical decision is one that a manager would have no hesitation \\ncommunicating to others both inside and outside of the organization because they would find it to be\\n\\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e.,\\n\\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

A handful of other states have adopted \\nsimilar legislation covering benefit corporations, sometimes referred to as “B \\ncorpor ations”, and there viability will depend in large part on the development of case \\nlaw regarding the permissi ble purposes of such corporations and the flexibility afforded \\nto directors in discharging their fiduciary duties.  \\n \\nThe Ethical Manager  \\n \\nWhen carrying out their duties and responsibilities managers may often find themselves confronted with an \\n“ethical dil emma”, which a situation in the manager must decide whether to take a certain course of action \\nthat helps another person or group and which is the “right thing to do” even if the action is not in the\\n\\ninterests of the organization as a whole  \\n• Esprit de corps: Promoting team spirit will give the organization a sense of unity  \\n \\nFinal ly, Jones and George  emphasized the following points regarding Follett’s concerns about emphasizing \\nthe “human side of the organization” and encouraging managers to involve their subordinates in planning \\nand decisions:  \\n \\n• Workers are the people who know the most about their job s and they should be involved in job \\nanalysis and participate with their managers in the work development process.  \\n• Provided that workers have the relevant knowledge, they, rather than their managers, should be in \\ncontrol of the work pro cess and the role of  managers should be limited to coaching and facilitating.  \\n• Organizations should rely upon cross -departmental teams composed of persons from different \\nfunctional departments to carry out required projects.\\n\\nprinciples when engaging in s upervisory b ehavior:  \\n \\n• The “mission” principle: Stick to the basic mission of the organization (e.g., service, quality, value to \\nthe customer) as the day -to-day guide to supervisory behavior and decision making  \\n• The “consistency” principle:  Demand the same fair and obj ective standards from every employee.  \\n• The “constituency” principle: Consider the needs and rights of as many organizational stakeholders as \\npossible in decision making  \\n• The “proactive” principle: Seek to exceed minimum expectations or rules when  taking acti on and \\nstrive to find ways to deliver as much as possible to others  \\n• The “holism” principle: Remember to keep the “big picture” in mind at all times and recognize the \\nimportance of the personal side of employees in addition to their professional  activities,  the service \\nside of business along with the profit side and the needs of the minority as well as the majority\\n\\n• Effective exercise of authority in an organization requires that positions be arranged hierarchically so \\nthat everyone knows who to report to and who reports to them.  \\n• Managers must create a well -defined system of rules (i.e., formal wr itten instructions t hat specify \\nactions that should be taken under different circumstances to achieve specific goals), standard \\noperating procedures (i.e., specific sets of written instructions about how to perform a certain aspect of \\na task), and norms (i .e., unwritten, info rmal codes of conduct that govern how people should act) so \\n \\n51 See generally C. Barnard, The Functions of the Execu tive (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, \\n1938).  See also J. Mahoney, “The Relevance of Chester I. Barnard’s Teachings to Contemporary  \\nManagement Education: Communicating the Aesthetics of Management”, International Journal of \\nOrganizational Theory a nd Behavior, 5(1) & (2) (2002), 159 -172.\\n\\n• Leadership should be based on kn owledge and expertis e rather than upon formal authority given to a \\nmanager based on his or her position in the hierarchy.  \\n• Power and authority in the organization should be fluid and flow to those persons who are best able to \\nassist the organization in achi eving its goals.  \\n \\nJones and George commented that Follett’s approach was considered to be quite radical during her time \\nand clearly her principals flew in the face of much of what Taylor advocated in pushing organizations to \\nadopt “scientific management”.  For example, scient ific management had no place for worker input into job \\nanalysis.  Not surprisingly, most organizations operating at the time Follett was writing continued to \\nembrace Taylorism; however, Follett’s ideas regarding “cross -functioning”, the  creation and use of  cross -\\ndepartmental teams, are now commonly applied by managers and modern organizations also rely heavily\\n\\nInternet; increasing globalization; increasing diversity in the w orkplace and  the \\nmarketplace; growing recognition of the importance of intellectual capital including, but \\nnot limited to, intellectual property; and more focused attention on ethical behavior by \\nfirms and their managers.71  Each of these factors has had, a nd will cont inue to have, a \\nsignificant influence on core managerial activities, notably each of the elements of \\norganizational design.  In addition, of course, management must remain focused on \\ncreating value for customers in an efficient manner and on de veloping and  implementing \\nstrategies to attract necessary inputs such as capital, technology and human resources.  \\n \\n71 P.

Smith suggested that the State should focus \\nits efforts on “public goods” and other activities that would protect society and its private  \\nmarkets, including a military force to protect from foreign attack, a police force to protect \\nprivate property rights, laws to guarantee contracts and, when necessary, support for \\n“infrastructure” projects that benefit everyone (i.e., roads and canals).  Smith’s ideas were \\nclearly at odds with the mercantilism that dominated most parts of Europe dur ing the \\nearly years of the Industrial Revolution.  Moreover, Smith’s theories assumed that\\n\\nshould be given little in the way of discretion and flexibility.  Theory X managers closely \\nsupervise their subordinates to mak e sure that they work hard, create strict work rules and \\nimplement a well -defined system of rewards and punishments in order to exert control \\nover those who work for them.57 \\n  \\nTheory Y, on the other hand, is based on the belief that employees have the highe r level \\nneed s identified in Maslow’s hierarchy (i.e., esteem and self -actualization) and calls for \\nthe following very different assumptions about workers and workplace: work can be as \\nnatural as play and rest; employees will be self -directed to fulfill the  workplace \\nobjectives if they are personally committed to them and the requisite level of \\ncommitment can be achieved by providing rewards that address higher needs such as \\nself-fulfillment; if employees are personally committed and properly rewarded they w ill\\n\\nIn contra st, managers  of organizations that are operating in a rapidly changing and \\nrelatively unstable environment may be forced to use an “organic” structure in which \\nauthority is decentralized and delegated downward in the hierarchy, roles are left \\n \\n60 Id. at 48 -49 (citing D.

He specifically emphasized the progress that had \\nbeen made with respect to productivity and attributed it to the discovery and development \\nof new  manufacturing technologies and innovations that had occurred in the way that \\nwork activities we re organized.  Specifically, he focused on how the division of labor that \\noccurred on the assembly line permitted necessary tasks and activities to be done more  \\nquickly due to specialization as well as the way that machinery reduced the time and\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n35 and that they have access to all of the organizational intellectual capital that they need in \\norder to successfully carry out their activities.  \\n \\n§26 --Ethics  \\n \\nEthical behavior and social responsibility have become two important to pics for \\nmanagers, particularly in light of the scandals and difficult economic times that have \\nmade their marks on the first decade of the new century.77  Government regulations such \\nas the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have transformed the landscape for corp orate \\ngovern ance of public companies in the US, with a particular focus on great disclosure and \\ntransparency, and ethical guidelines have been promulgated by respected groups around \\nthe world including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United \\nNations Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business \\nEnterprises.  Management concerns regarding compliance are no longer limited to their\\n\\ngovernment’s economic development role.

The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n36  \\n• Individual ethics are  personal st andards and values that determine how people view their \\nresponsibilities to other people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self -\\ninterest is at stake  \\n• Occupational ethics are standards that govern how members of a p articular pr ofession, trade or craft \\nshould conduct themselves when performing their work -related activities  \\n• Organizational ethics are the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view \\ntheir duties and responsibilities to the organ ization’s st akeholders (e.g., owners, managers, employees, \\nsuppliers and distributors, customers and the surrounding community)  \\n• Societal ethics are standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in \\nmatters that involve issues such  as fairness , justice, poverty and individual rights\\n\\nKelly and Williams also offered ethical rules and principles that managers could use to analyze the impact \\nof their decisions on org anizational stakeholders:  \\n \\n• The “utilitarian” rule:  An ethical decision is one that produces the greatest good for the greatest \\nnumber of people, which means that managers should compare alternative courses of action based on \\nthe benefits and costs of each  alternative  for different organizational stakeholders  \\n• The “moral rights” rule: An ethical decision is the one that best maintains and protects the fundamental \\nrights and privileges of the people affected by it, which means managers must take into account the \\neffectiv e of each alternative decision on the rights of each affected stakeholder group.  \\n• The “justice” rule: An ethical decision is one that distributes both the benefits and the harms among the \\norganizational stakeholders in a fair, equitable or impar tial manner\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and\\n\\n• The “practical” rule: An ethical decision is one that a manager would have no hesitation \\ncommunicating to others both inside and outside of the organization because they would find it to be\\n\\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e.,\\n\\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

A handful of other states have adopted \\nsimilar legislation covering benefit corporations, sometimes referred to as “B \\ncorpor ations”, and there viability will depend in large part on the development of case \\nlaw regarding the permissi ble purposes of such corporations and the flexibility afforded \\nto directors in discharging their fiduciary duties.  \\n \\nThe Ethical Manager  \\n \\nWhen carrying out their duties and responsibilities managers may often find themselves confronted with an \\n“ethical dil emma”, which a situation in the manager must decide whether to take a certain course of action \\nthat helps another person or group and which is the “right thing to do” even if the action is not in the\\n\\ninterests of the organization as a whole  \\n• Esprit de corps: Promoting team spirit will give the organization a sense of unity  \\n \\nFinal ly, Jones and George  emphasized the following points regarding Follett’s concerns about emphasizing \\nthe “human side of the organization” and encouraging managers to involve their subordinates in planning \\nand decisions:  \\n \\n• Workers are the people who know the most about their job s and they should be involved in job \\nanalysis and participate with their managers in the work development process.  \\n• Provided that workers have the relevant knowledge, they, rather than their managers, should be in \\ncontrol of the work pro cess and the role of  managers should be limited to coaching and facilitating.  \\n• Organizations should rely upon cross -departmental teams composed of persons from different \\nfunctional departments to carry out required projects.\\n\\nprinciples when engaging in s upervisory b ehavior:  \\n \\n• The “mission” principle: Stick to the basic mission of the organization (e.g., service, quality, value to \\nthe customer) as the day -to-day guide to supervisory behavior and decision making  \\n• The “consistency” principle:  Demand the same fair and obj ective standards from every employee.  \\n• The “constituency” principle: Consider the needs and rights of as many organizational stakeholders as \\npossible in decision making  \\n• The “proactive” principle: Seek to exceed minimum expectations or rules when  taking acti on and \\nstrive to find ways to deliver as much as possible to others  \\n• The “holism” principle: Remember to keep the “big picture” in mind at all times and recognize the \\nimportance of the personal side of employees in addition to their professional  activities,  the service \\nside of business along with the profit side and the needs of the minority as well as the majority\\n\\n• Effective exercise of authority in an organization requires that positions be arranged hierarchically so \\nthat everyone knows who to report to and who reports to them.  \\n• Managers must create a well -defined system of rules (i.e., formal wr itten instructions t hat specify \\nactions that should be taken under different circumstances to achieve specific goals), standard \\noperating procedures (i.e., specific sets of written instructions about how to perform a certain aspect of \\na task), and norms (i .e., unwritten, info rmal codes of conduct that govern how people should act) so \\n \\n51 See generally C.

Barnard’s Teachings to Contemporary  \\nManagement Education: Communicating the Aesthetics of Management”, International Journal of \\nOrganizational Theory a nd Behavior, 5(1) & (2) (2002), 159 -172.\\n\\n• Leadership should be based on kn owledge and expertis e rather than upon formal authority given to a \\nmanager based on his or her position in the hierarchy.  \\n• Power and authority in the organization should be fluid and flow to those persons who are best able to \\nassist the organization in achi eving its goals.  \\n \\nJones and George commented that Follett’s approach was considered to be quite radical during her time \\nand clearly her principals flew in the face of much of what Taylor advocated in pushing organizations to \\nadopt “scientific management”.  For example, scient ific management had no place for worker input into job \\nanalysis.  Not surprisingly, most organizations operating at the time Follett was writing continued to \\nembrace Taylorism; however, Follett’s ideas regarding “cross -functioning”, the  creation and use of  cross -\\ndepartmental teams, are now commonly applied by managers and modern organizations also rely heavily\\n\\nInternet; increasing globalization; increasing diversity in the w orkplace and  the \\nmarketplace; growing recognition of the importance of intellectual capital including, but \\nnot limited to, intellectual property; and more focused attention on ethical behavior by \\nfirms and their managers.71  Each of these factors has had, a nd will cont inue to have, a \\nsignificant influence on core managerial activities, notably each of the elements of \\norganizational design.  In addition, of course, management must remain focused on \\ncreating value for customers in an efficient manner and on de veloping and  implementing \\nstrategies to attract necessary inputs such as capital, technology and human resources.  \\n \\n71 P.

Smith suggested that the State should focus \\nits efforts on “public goods” and other activities that would protect society and its private  \\nmarkets, including a military force to protect from foreign attack, a police force to protect \\nprivate property rights, laws to guarantee contracts and, when necessary, support for \\n“infrastructure” projects that benefit everyone (i.e., roads and canals).  Smith’s ideas were \\nclearly at odds with the mercantilism that dominated most parts of Europe dur ing the \\nearly years of the Industrial Revolution.  Moreover, Smith’s theories assumed that\\n\\nshould be given little in the way of discretion and flexibility.  Theory X managers closely \\nsupervise their subordinates to mak e sure that they work hard, create strict work rules and \\nimplement a well -defined system of rewards and punishments in order to exert control \\nover those who work for them.57 \\n  \\nTheory Y, on the other hand, is based on the belief that employees have the highe r level \\nneed s identified in Maslow’s hierarchy (i.e., esteem and self -actualization) and calls for \\nthe following very different assumptions about workers and workplace: work can be as \\nnatural as play and rest; employees will be self -directed to fulfill the  workplace \\nobjectives if they are personally committed to them and the requisite level of \\ncommitment can be achieved by providing rewards that address higher needs such as \\nself-fulfillment; if employees are personally committed and properly rewarded they w ill\\n\\nIn contra st, managers  of organizations that are operating in a rapidly changing and \\nrelatively unstable environment may be forced to use an “organic” structure in which \\nauthority is decentralized and delegated downward in the hierarchy, roles are left \\n \\n60 Id. at 48 -49 (citing D.

He specifically emphasized the progress that had \\nbeen made with respect to productivity and attributed it to the discovery and development \\nof new  manufacturing technologies and innovations that had occurred in the way that \\nwork activities we re organized.  Specifically, he focused on how the division of labor that \\noccurred on the assembly line permitted necessary tasks and activities to be done more  \\nquickly due to specialization as well as the way that machinery reduced the time and\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n35 and that they have access to all of the organizational intellectual capital that they need in \\norder to successfully carry out their activities.  \\n \\n§26 --Ethics  \\n \\nEthical behavior and social responsibility have become two important to pics for \\nmanagers, particularly in light of the scandals and difficult economic times that have \\nmade their marks on the first decade of the new century.77  Government regulations such \\nas the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have transformed the landscape for corp orate \\ngovern ance of public companies in the US, with a particular focus on great disclosure and \\ntransparency, and ethical guidelines have been promulgated by respected groups around \\nthe world including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United \\nNations Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business \\nEnterprises.  Management concerns regarding compliance are no longer limited to their\\n\\ngovernment’s economic development role.

As a practical matter, this shift would mean that managers could \\nno longer limit the ir activitie s to explaining and controlling technical aspects of the work \\nperformed by their subordinates but must instead be able to understand human needs and \\nbehavior in their organizations and the workings of the “informal organization”, which is \\nthe s ystem of beh avioral rules and norms that emerge in a group and must be taken into \\naccount in any attempt to manage or change the behavior of members of the group.52 \\n \\nThe foundation for behavioral management theory included studies by Mayo and others \\nthat pr ovided evide nce that human relations and the social needs of workers are important\\n\\nphysically able  to carry out orders issued by their managers.

As a practical matter, this shift would mean that managers could \\nno longer limit the ir activitie s to explaining and controlling technical aspects of the work \\nperformed by their subordinates but must instead be able to understand human needs and \\nbehavior in their organizations and the workings of the “informal organization”, which is \\nthe s ystem of beh avioral rules and norms that emerge in a group and must be taken into \\naccount in any attempt to manage or change the behavior of members of the group.52 \\n \\nThe foundation for behavioral management theory included studies by Mayo and others \\nthat pr ovided evide nce that human relations and the social needs of workers are important\\n\\nphysically able  to carry out orders issued by their managers.  In order to achieve \\nacceptance, managers needed to focus on developing a sense of common purpose among \\nemployees and an organizational culture that recognized the need for cooperation and \\nvalued those who wer e willing to cooperate to achieve the goals and purposes of the \\norganization.  Barnard also was among the first to acknowledge the existence of an \\n“informal organization”, which refer to the cliques or other groups that inevitably form \\nwithin an organizati on and which can provide a valuable service in collecting and \\ndisseminating information.  Barnard’s focus on the mindset of employees previewed the \\nemergence of the next major school of management thought discussed below: behavioral \\nmanagement theory. 51 \\n \\nThe Classical Administrative School of Management  \\n \\nJones and George summarized the core principals of several of main theories associated with the “classical\\nHuman: According to Kelly and Williams what is ethics?\"\n",

Management  Studies  \\n35 and that they have access to all of the organizational intellectual capital that they need in \\norder to successfully carry out their activities.  \\n \\n§26 --Ethics  \\n \\nEthical behavior and social responsibility have become two important to pics for \\nmanagers, particularly in light of the scandals and difficult economic times that have \\nmade their marks on the first decade of the new century.77  Government regulations such \\nas the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have transformed the landscape for corp orate \\ngovern ance of public companies in the US, with a particular focus on great disclosure and \\ntransparency, and ethical guidelines have been promulgated by respected groups around \\nthe world including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United \\nNations Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business \\nEnterprises.  Management concerns regarding compliance are no longer limited to their \\nown organizations and are now being extended to business partners such a s suppliers \\nunder new laws that call for firms to monitor their supply chains for evidence of human \\ntrafficking and subpar working conditions.   \\n \\nAnother interesting development in the US is the recognition of new legal forms of \\ncorporations that explicitl y allow dire ctors to consider not only the interests of \\nshareholders but also other important stakeholders such as employees, consumers and the \\ncommunity.   California, for example, permits the formation of “benefit corporations” for \\nthe purpose of creating  general pub lic ben efit, which is defined by statute  as a material \\npositive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole, as assessed against a \\nthird -party standard that satisfies certain requirements.  Dire ctors of benefit corporations \\nare requ ired to cons ider the impacts of any action or proposed action upon specified \\nconsiderations including, among others, the shareholders and employees of the \\ncorporation, customers of the corp oration who are beneficiaries of the general or specific \\npublic ben efit purpose s and the environment.  A handful of other states have adopted \\nsimilar legislation covering benefit corporations, sometimes referred to as “B \\ncorpor ations”, and there viability will depend in large part on the development of case \\nlaw regarding the permissi ble purposes of such corporations and the flexibility afforded \\nto directors in discharging their fiduciary duties.  \\n \\nThe Ethical Manager  \\n \\nWhen carrying out their duties and responsibilities managers may often find themselves confronted with an \\n“ethical dil emma”, which a situation in the manager must decide whether to take a certain course of action \\nthat helps another person or group and which is the “right thing to do” even if the action is not in the \\nmanager’s own self -interest.  In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.  The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and \\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e., \\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

Immigration and shifts in \\nsocietal ideas about the roles of women have transformed the labor force to a dyna mic \\nand comp lex mix of men, women, Caucasians, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian \\nAmericans and others with diverse racial, national and ethnic backgrounds.  As a result, \\nissues have arisen in achieving the consensus necessary to set and pursue common goa ls \\nand objec tives and creating and maintaining a strong organizational culture is a much \\nmore difficult task for managers.  The response has been an increase in diversity training \\nwithin organizations to provide everyone with a better understanding of the perspectives  \\nof others with different backgrounds.  Workplace diversity matches changes in the \\nmarketplace and companies must take into account the specific preferences of each of the \\ngroups mentioned above when designing and marketing their products and s ervices.74 \\n \\n§25 --Intellectual capital  \\n \\nIntellectual capital has joined the traditional factors of land, labor, money and raw \\nmaterials as essential contributors to the efficiency and competitiveness of business \\norganizations and managers must have a clear understandin g of the elements of \\nintellectual capital and how they can be used in developing and implementing strategies.  \\nIntellectual capital appears in the growing sophistication and educational background of \\nthe workforce and in the nature of the produ cts and serv ices developed and marketed by \\nbusiness organizations.

people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self -\\ninterest is at stake  \\n• Occupational ethics are standards that govern how members of a p articular pr ofession, trade or craft \\nshould conduct themselves when performing their work -related activities  \\n• Organizational ethics are the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view \\ntheir duties and responsibilities to the organ ization’s st akeholders (e.g., owners, managers, employees, \\nsuppliers and distributors, customers and the surrounding community)  \\n• Societal ethics are standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in \\nmatters that involve issues such  as fairness , justice, poverty and individual rights  \\n \\nVan Auken argued that ethical managers demonstrated certain characteristics including:  \\n \\n• Looking out for the interests of others, including customers, employees and minority members of \\nsociety  \\n• Valuing e mployees as people as well as workers and giving respect to their family responsibilities, \\ncommunity involvement and religious beliefs  \\n• Not deceiving people and simply telling them what they want to hear rather than the truth  \\n• Not playing psychological games  with others , such as blame -shifting, practicing one -upmanship or \\nplaying favorites  \\n• Valuing people over pragmatism and recognizing that how things are achieved is just as important as \\nwhat is achieved.  \\n• Focusing on the ultimate objective or mission (the “en ds”) more th an rules and regulations (the \\n“means”)  \\n• A commitment to ideals beyond self, such as honesty, fair play, and quality work  \\n \\nVan Auken went on to recommend that managers understand and adhere to several guiding ethical \\nprinciples when engaging in s upervisory b ehavior:  \\n \\n• The “mission” principle: Stick to the basic mission of the organization (e.g., service, quality, value to \\nthe customer) as the day -to-day guide to supervisory behavior and decision making  \\n• The “consistency” principle:  Demand the same fair and obj ective standards from every employee.  \\n• The “constituency” principle: Consider the needs and rights of as many organizational stakeholders as \\npossible in decision making  \\n• The “proactive” principle: Seek to exceed minimum expectations or rules when  taking acti on and \\nstrive to find ways to deliver as much as possible to others  \\n• The “holism” principle: Remember to keep the “big picture” in mind at all times and recognize the \\nimportance of the personal side of employees in addition to their professional  activities,  the service \\nside of business along with the profit side and the needs of the minority as well as the majority  \\n \\nKelly and Williams also offered ethical rules and principles that managers could use to analyze the impact \\nof their decisions on org anizational stakeholders:  \\n \\n• The “utilitarian” rule:  An ethical decision is one that produces the greatest good for the greatest \\nnumber of people, which means that managers should compare alternative courses of action based on \\nthe benefits and costs of each  alternative  for different organizational stakeholders  \\n• The “moral rights” rule: An ethical decision is the one that best maintains and protects the fundamental \\nrights and privileges of the people affected by it, which means managers must take into account the \\neffectiv e of each alternative decision on the rights of each affected stakeholder group.  \\n• The “justice” rule: An ethical decision is one that distributes both the benefits and the harms among the \\norganizational stakeholders in a fair, equitable or impar tial manner  \\n• The “practical” rule: An ethical decision is one that a manager would have no hesitation \\ncommunicating to others both inside and outside of the organization because they would find it to be\\n\\nIntroduction to

\\nEthical behavior and social responsibility have become two important to pics for \\nmanagers, particularly in light of the scandals and difficult economic times that have \\nmade their marks on the first decade of the new century.77  Government regulations such \\nas the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have transformed the landscape for corp orate \\ngovern ance of public companies in the US, with a particular focus on great disclosure and \\ntransparency, and ethical guidelines have been promulgated by respected groups around \\nthe world including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United \\nNations Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business \\nEnterprises.  Management concerns regarding compliance are no longer limited to their \\nown organizations and are now being extended to business partners such a s suppliers \\nunder new laws that call for firms to monitor their supply chains for evidence of human \\ntrafficking and subpar working conditions.   \\n \\nAnother interesting development in the US is the recognition of new legal forms of \\ncorporations that explicitl y allow dire ctors to consider not only the interests of \\nshareholders but also other important stakeholders such as employees, consumers and the \\ncommunity.   California, for example, permits the formation of “benefit corporations” for \\nthe purpose of creating  general pub lic ben efit, which is defined by statute  as a material \\npositive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole, as assessed against a \\nthird -party standard that satisfies certain requirements.  Dire ctors of benefit corporations \\nare requ ired to cons ider the impacts of any action or proposed action upon specified \\nconsiderations including, among others, the shareholders and employees of the \\ncorporation, customers of the corp oration who are beneficiaries of the general or specific \\npublic ben efit purpose s and the environment.  A handful of other states have adopted \\nsimilar legislation covering benefit corporations, sometimes referred to as “B \\ncorpor ations”, and there viability will depend in large part on the development of case \\nlaw regarding the permissi ble purposes of such corporations and the flexibility afforded \\nto directors in discharging their fiduciary duties.  \\n \\nThe Ethical Manager  \\n \\nWhen carrying out their duties and responsibilities managers may often find themselves confronted with an \\n“ethical dil emma”, which a situation in the manager must decide whether to take a certain course of action \\nthat helps another person or group and which is the “right thing to do” even if the action is not in the \\nmanager’s own self -interest.  In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.  The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and \\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e., \\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

Immigration and shifts in \\nsocietal ideas about the roles of women have transformed the labor force to a dyna mic \\nand comp lex mix of men, women, Caucasians, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian \\nAmericans and others with diverse racial, national and ethnic backgrounds.  As a result, \\nissues have arisen in achieving the consensus necessary to set and pursue common goa ls \\nand objec tives and creating and maintaining a strong organizational culture is a much \\nmore difficult task for managers.  The response has been an increase in diversity training \\nwithin organizations to provide everyone with a better understanding of the perspectives  \\nof others with different backgrounds.  Workplace diversity matches changes in the \\nmarketplace and companies must take into account the specific preferences of each of the \\ngroups mentioned above when designing and marketing their products and s ervices.74 \\n \\n§25 --Intellectual capital  \\n \\nIntellectual capital has joined the traditional factors of land, labor, money and raw \\nmaterials as essential contributors to the efficiency and competitiveness of business \\norganizations and managers must have a clear understandin g of the elements of \\nintellectual capital and how they can be used in developing and implementing strategies.  \\nIntellectual capital appears in the growing sophistication and educational background of \\nthe workforce and in the nature of the produ cts and serv ices developed and marketed by \\nbusiness organizations.

When it comes to large language models, these qualities can be applied in the context of overseeing and ensuring the responsible use of such models. Some key qualities of a good ethical manager in this context include:\\n\\n1. Transparency: An ethical manager should prioritize transparency by openly communicating the capabilities and limitations of large language models. This includes being transparent about the data used to train the models, potential biases, and any ethical considerations associated with their use.\\n\\n2. Accountability: A good ethical manager should take responsibility for the actions and decisions made using large language models. They should be accountable for any potential negative consequences and actively work towards mitigating risks and addressing ethical concerns.\\n\\n3. Fairness: Ethical managers should strive for fairness in the use of large language models. This involves ensuring that the models are trained on diverse and representative datasets, avoiding discrimination or bias, and promoting equal opportunities for all users.\\n\\n4. Privacy and Security: Managers should prioritize the privacy and security of user data when utilizing large language models. They should implement robust measures to protect sensitive information and comply with relevant data protection regulations.\\n\\n5. Continuous Learning: Given the evolving nature of large language models, ethical managers should stay updated on the latest research, best practices, and ethical guidelines. They should actively engage in ongoing learning and adapt their practices accordingly to ensure responsible and ethical use of these models.\\n\\n6. Stakeholder Engagement: Ethical managers should actively engage with stakeholders, including users, employees, and the wider community, to understand their concerns and perspectives. By involving stakeholders in decision-making processes, managers can ensure that the use of large language models aligns with their values and expectations.\\n\\n7. Ethical Decision-Making: A good ethical manager should possess strong ethical decision-making skills. They should consider the potential impact of their actions, weigh the ethical implications, and make informed choices that prioritize the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.\\n\\nBy embodying these qualities, ethical managers can effectively navigate the challenges and complexities associated with large language models, promoting their responsible and ethical use.\",\n",

When it comes to large language models, these qualities can be applied in the context of overseeing and ensuring the responsible use of such models. Some key qualities of a good ethical manager in this context include:\\n\\n1. Transparency: An ethical manager should prioritize transparency by openly communicating the capabilities and limitations of large language models. This includes being transparent about the data used to train the models, potential biases, and any ethical considerations associated with their use.\\n\\n2. Accountability: A good ethical manager should take responsibility for the actions and decisions made using large language models. They should be accountable for any potential negative consequences and actively work towards mitigating risks and addressing ethical concerns.\\n\\n3. Fairness: Ethical managers should strive for fairness in the use of large language models. This involves ensuring that the models are trained on diverse and representative datasets, avoiding discrimination or bias, and promoting equal opportunities for all users.\\n\\n4. Privacy and Security: Managers should prioritize the privacy and security of user data when utilizing large language models. They should implement robust measures to protect sensitive information and comply with relevant data protection regulations.\\n\\n5. Continuous Learning: Given the evolving nature of large language models, ethical managers should stay updated on the latest research, best practices, and ethical guidelines. They should actively engage in ongoing learning and adapt their practices accordingly to ensure responsible and ethical use of these models.\\n\\n6. Stakeholder Engagement: Ethical managers should actively engage with stakeholders, including users, employees, and the wider community, to understand their concerns and perspectives. By involving stakeholders in decision-making processes, managers can ensure that the use of large language models aligns with their values and expectations.\\n\\n7. Ethical Decision-Making: A good ethical manager should possess strong ethical decision-making skills. They should consider the potential impact of their actions, weigh the ethical implications, and make informed choices that prioritize the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.\\n\\nBy embodying these qualities, ethical managers can effectively navigate the challenges and complexities associated with large language models, promoting their responsible and ethical use.\",\n",

Not surprisingly, most organizations operating at the time Follett was writing continued to \\nembrace Taylorism; however, Follett’s ideas regarding “cross -functioning”, the  creation and use of  cross -\\ndepartmental teams, are now commonly applied by managers and modern organizations also rely heavily \\non self -managed teams and empowerment initiatives that allow employees to contribute their knowledge \\nand expertise.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n35 and that they have access to all of the organizational intellectual capital that they need in \\norder to successfully carry out their activities.  \\n \\n§26 --Ethics  \\n \\nEthical behavior and social responsibility have become two important to pics for \\nmanagers, particularly in light of the scandals and difficult economic times that have \\nmade their marks on the first decade of the new century.77  Government regulations such \\nas the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 have transformed the landscape for corp orate \\ngovern ance of public companies in the US, with a particular focus on great disclosure and \\ntransparency, and ethical guidelines have been promulgated by respected groups around \\nthe world including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United \\nNations Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business \\nEnterprises.  Management concerns regarding compliance are no longer limited to their \\nown organizations and are now being extended to business partners such a s suppliers \\nunder new laws that call for firms to monitor their supply chains for evidence of human \\ntrafficking and subpar working conditions.   \\n \\nAnother interesting development in the US is the recognition of new legal forms of \\ncorporations that explicitl y allow dire ctors to consider not only the interests of \\nshareholders but also other important stakeholders such as employees, consumers and the \\ncommunity.   California, for example, permits the formation of “benefit corporations” for \\nthe purpose of creating  general pub lic ben efit, which is defined by statute  as a material \\npositive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole, as assessed against a \\nthird -party standard that satisfies certain requirements.

In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.
