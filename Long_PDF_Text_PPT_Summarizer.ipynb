He explains that angels invest their own money and are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs, provide valuable advice, and do not need nor want publicity. Additionally, he notes that hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace effect. He further mentions that angels do fewer deals, are happy to split them, and invest at a point where the stream is broader. The author also mentions that most investors are momentum investors, and invest in companies they don't understand. He states that splitting deals has similar advantages to confusing paternity, and is often done out of fear of looking bad. VCs are often emotional and not businesslike, so rejection should be seen as a question rather than a statement, and the negotiation never stops until the closing. A termsheet, which outlines the key terms of a deal, is also discussed, as it is not legally binding but it is a definite step that marks the beginning. The author also mentions startup school, and that potential speakers get to see famous startup founders and realize they are just ordinary guys. He suggests that VCs may sometimes use technicalities to get out of deals and that startups should aim to be small, ugly, and indestruct\""

              "'\\n\\nLongformer and BigBird are two models designed to address the limitations of BERT, which is limited to 512 words per paragraph due to its use of 512 \"positional encoding vectors\". Both models use a technique called Sparse Self-Attention to approximate self-attention, allowing them to handle longer sequences with reasonable speed and memory. BigBird is the more recent model and was first published in July of 2020 by Manzil Zaheer and colleagues from Google. It was updated in January of 2021 and uses a sliding window size of 192 tokens, combining a local windowed attention with a task motivated attention operation, which scales linearly with the sequence length. Additionally, BigBird introduced a third technique of randomly selecting additional tokens to attend to, represented by the orange cells below. To justify this, they draw from graph theory, where making connections randomly should produce a graph where the number of “hops” between any two nodes is low. BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving the properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Long-Range Arena (https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena) provides a benchmark suite for many of these efficient Transformer'"
